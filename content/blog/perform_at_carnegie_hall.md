When I was a little girl learning piano, practicing often felt like a dreadful chore. I remember sitting on the piano bench, feet barely touching the floor, thinking of a million things I’d rather be doing.

But my mom always had a way of lifting my spirits. Whenever I complained or felt discouraged, she would smile and say, “You never know… maybe one day you’ll play at Carnegie Hall...” 

Here I am at Carnegie Hall as the 1st Place Winner! You know what? It is actually not that hard 😊.
