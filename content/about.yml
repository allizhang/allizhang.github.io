  Hi, I'm **Allision Zhang**, a high school senior living in Chicago suburbs. 
  
  ### Area of interest for college

  Pre-med majors such as Biology, Biochemistry, or Chemistry are my top choices for college. I am passionate about understanding the human body and mind, and I aspire to contribute to medical research and healthcare in the future.

  ### Outside the School

  I'm driven by a passion for continuous learning and a desire to make a positive impact through volunteering with my skills including piano teaching/performance and digital designing.

  ### My short-term plans

  It is exciting to know that I am going to finish my high school in less than a half year and I am going to college in Fall 2026. I have planned quite a number of things this coming summer, including traveling to Asia with my sister, catching up on my digital learning, and volunteering at senior centers etc. Fingers crossed that I will be accepted into my dream college! 

  Thanks for stopping by. Feel free [get in touch](/#contact) if you'd like to collaborate!
